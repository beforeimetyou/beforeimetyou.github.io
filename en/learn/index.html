					<strong>Katarína Kárászová, clinical psychologist, psychotherapist with psychotraumatology specialization</strong>

					<p>The film “Before I Met You” by Zuzana Límová is a very personal, truthful and painful picture about how the current birth system in our hospitals affects souls and bodies of women and their children, and thus the whole society, including fathers. The way how we handle birth or death reflects the health of whole our society.</p>

					<p>Conditions connected with our birth deeply impact our health and future. Our bodies remember this key experience. Birth influences the relationships which we create with ourselves and the world around us. During the birth it is determined whether we feel secure, loved and welcomed throughout our lives or, on the other hand, there is a feeling of insecurity, fear and loneliness, feeling we were left in this world without any connection to a close person. Only a mother that is treated with respect, support and love and is in contact with her life-giving power creates the base for a happy beginning of a new live.</p>

						<p>During my work experience as a psychotherapist I have met a lot of adults whose current problems arise in a large extent from these very early traumatic events (which lot of people mistakenly think that if we don’t remember them they don’t influence us). I have also met a lot of women who are affected by traumatic treatment during the delivery. Wounds on their bodies and souls heal for a long time.</p>
						<p>In this film we can look into a mirror and ask ourselves whether our health system supports human dignity and health or, on the contrary, destroys the most important we have. With all the respect to good intentions and challenging work of doctors I feel like something is wrong here. I have also met doctors and health workers who, somewhere in their subconsciousness, start to feel that there is really something against nature in our health system – but it is very dangerous to admit it.</p>
						<p>It seems that we have gradually lost the contact with ourselves, with our nature and humanity. Respect and humility have disappeared. Creation of a new life and its birth is something so important and deserves our respect. Every human being, including a mother and her child, deserves respect too. Mothers in this special and very vulnerable condition need protection, safety, sensitive support and respect of their and children's dignity.</p>
						<p>Current birth and post-birth care appears to be deeply traumatic for a lot of women and children, and thus basically for the whole families. Barbora Nádvorníková, a women's rituals specialist, says: <em>“Instead of supporting strength in women it is taken away from them. They try to persuade us that we cannot give birth without the doctors' help… A woman comes to the hospital lacking any power to control her birth. The birth is no longer perceived as a mystical gate, through which a woman and her child pass to encounter the power of life and death...Women should be glorified for the big effort of delivering a child but today the glory and respect often goes to her doctor and mothers believe it should be like this. However it is a woman and her body which we should be thankful to in the first place and a great wisdom of the babies who know the way out in the second place.”</em></p>
						<p>A lot of people who work in this system lost power to change it. If they want to survive they have to put the empathy aside and do only what they believe is right, however, then they treat human beings as objects. Because they remain just in the scientific position and disconnect from the humanity and empathy, they lose not only negative emotions but also the positive ones, as for example joy.</p>
						<p>I am afraid that a lot of medical workers are in a difficult position and suffer by this system because they have to deny their human nature and they cannot perceive the whole reality. If they could feel the same as women they have treated, it would not be acceptable. I am thankful to every single person within this system who is able to recognize what is really going on and treat women and their babies as unique human beings who deserve respect in the most vulnerable and important moments.</p>
